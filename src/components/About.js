        <h1>About Taylor A. Cox</h1>
        <p>I am quite the geographical mixture with childhood roots in Kentucky, college memories in Indiana, a Boston Red Sox cap on my head, and a new home in Tampa, Florida. Hailing from a background in creative work in an agency setting, I thrive on juggling multiple projects at once. I am a purveyor of ideas that inspire others and elevate possibilities of projects.</p>
        <p>Outside of pushing creative boundaries on a daily basis, I dabble in brush lettering, tote around my Canon DSLR, and practice improving my basic understanding of the Japanese language.</p>
